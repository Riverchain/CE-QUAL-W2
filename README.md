# CE-QUAL-W2

Import the classes and run the main class while the CE-qual result txt file is saved in the same folder. The final matrix will be saved in the same folder. This method is useful for those water scientists or engineers who aim for employing a reduced-order based CE-QUAL-W2 model for simulation of polutants concentration in dam reservoirs.
